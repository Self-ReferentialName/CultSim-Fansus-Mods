# CultSim-Fansus-Mods
Modding and code, primarily for the "Fansus", created by fans of the game Cultist Simulator.
Will be updated as branches and mods are made.

To upload a mod, create a new branch and add the relevant code to that branch. Once done, make a pull request and a collaborator will be able to merge it with the rest of the code.
